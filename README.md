# Voice Out

## About

This is an app that allows anyone to post comments/remarks about government agencies to voice out their opinions on how they can do better, or on the positive side, what they are doing good.

## Why we built this

We believe voicing out about problems people are facing are one way to unite people with common issues, and one way to let the government agencies know what they are doing well and not well.

## Tech Stack

- Front-End: Next JS, React, TypeScript
- Database: Cloud Firestore
- Machine Learning: Natural Language API by Google Cloud

## Features for the App

- Users can submit a form and 600+ government agencies
- Homepage display the complaints/compliements/remarks
- The comments shows sentiment scores as well as auto-generated categories using the Google Cloud Natural Language API
- Users can upvote or downvote posts and they will have higher prioritization

## Future goals

Our goal is for government agencies to have admin access to these comments and acknolwedge the comments by clicking the check mark on the comments, and even reach out to users to publicly display their email and name
